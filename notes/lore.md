Here is the lore dump for my game.

I’m thinking futuristic military sci-fi. I want the enemies to be both human units and also alien units. Yeah let’s do that. Add to my campaign story notes that the humans that the player faces are rebels who want the aliens to take over or something like that, all other humans are trying to defeat the aliens, this explains why the player faces humans early on. The human enemies in the early campaign are rebels—a faction that believes the aliens should take over and fights against the rest of humanity.
✔ The player represents the last line of defense for Earth and its allied forces.
✔ Why do the rebels support the aliens?

They believe humanity is doomed and that resistance is futile.
They think the aliens will spare them if they help overthrow Earth’s defenses.
Some may even be enhanced or brainwashed by alien technology.
✔ This justifies why the player fights human enemies first before transitioning to full alien waves.
✔ As the campaign progresses, the aliens begin taking over, and the rebels become less relevant as the true war unfolds.
Early waves focus on human rebels, meaning bullets & shrapnel (Machine Gun, Shotgun) are effective early on.
As the alien threat grows, the Flamethrower Tower becomes more valuable, and players need to adapt their tower choices.
The player’s goal is to hold off both the rebels and the alien invasion, leading to the final battle on the Orbital Defense Platform.
\Nope, but it gives me an idea, maybe later in the campaign the aliens create hybrid or brainwashed humans like you mentioned so the player has to fight them again on the final platform level
